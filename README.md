# MyBlog

by Zhengtian Zhang

MyBlog is a blog where you can post anything. From journal to thesis, as long as it has a title and a content.

Here is how to use it:
- Once you opened the homepage, it should show all the existing blogs in the database, but only the titles.
- You can post a new blog using the form at the top of the page. Neither title nor content can be empty.
- If you want to read the detail of a blog, just click the title. The content, a "Remove" button and a "Edit" button will pop up. Repeatly clicking will not result in multiple popping.
- The "Remove" button will delete the blog.
- The "Edit" button will create a form with your original blog title and content in it at the buttom of the page, where you can edit them. Click "Update" to save the changes. No matter how many times you click "Edit", there will only be one update form.
- There is data validation in both frontend and backend
